# Weather Conditions
This is another project from the TOP curriculum. The objective of this project is for the coder to learn how to work with APIs. 

Since there wasn't much direction on what to do or not do, I decided to build a weather app that I will want to use, so this went from just getting and displaying basic weather data to my dream weather app.

The project called for the use of the `Visual Crossing API` but I opted for using `Open-Meteo API` instead. I'm also using other APIs for IP GeoLocation `ipgeolocation.io`.  I've also used some libraries `hint.css`, `moment.js`, and `charts.js`.


My goal was to build a weather app that can provide weather conditions for any where in the world. I decided to have the app try to figure out your location based on your ISP than to use a default location like "Los Angeles" or "London", that way the initial weather data will be somewhat relevant.
